            <dd>- In 2016 i completed the Iron Man challenge. You have to carry a 40 pound rucksack from start to finish. At one point in the race you also have to single-handedly pick up a canoe and run a 4 kilometre portage. Then you have to enter the water and paddle 8 kilometres.And just when your tired legs have seized up in the canoe you have to get out and run again for a course total of 50 kilometres. </dd>
